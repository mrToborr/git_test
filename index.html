<h2>Italian Chicken Marinade:</h2>
<p>This Italian dressing chicken marinade is a super simple but delicious way to add flavor before grilling.</p>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking dish; add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate</li>
    <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade</li>
    <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</li>
